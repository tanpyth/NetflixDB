# NetflixDB
Design a simple version of Netflix Database for managing user and content information.

# This project contains 3 tables
1. User table
2. Content table
3. Credit Card info table


I have created 3 different text files to store DB creation (DDL), insertion, and manipulating queries (DML)

# Through this project I learned - 
1. Data types for SQLlite. Differences between Integer and Numneric.
2. I learned about Primary Key, Foriegn keys, null and non null values. Also how to add constraints and set Auto-increment table ids.
3. I learned about Datetime format for SQLite using text data type.
4. I also learned about security concerns related to storing sensitive information like passwords (use hashing) and bank details (use encryption)
5. Last but not the least, I also learned how to setup a Git repo, pull and push changes, merge branches :D
